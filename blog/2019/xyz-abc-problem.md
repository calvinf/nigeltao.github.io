# The XYZ ABC Problem

The Go programming language was released [10 years
ago](https://blog.golang.org/10years). Some people love it, some people hate
it. You can't please all of the people all of the time, but I'm pretty happy
with it, despite its obvious flaws and its subtle flaws.

One of my favorite opinions about Go was written by Jason Moiron in 2015. The
long version is a blog post titled ["For Better or For
Worse"](http://jmoiron.net/blog/for-better-or-for-worse/). The short version is
a [tweet](https://twitter.com/jmoiron/status/662156246452060161):

> You've missed the point if you agree that "#Golang is badly designed" and
> "People find it easy to write good software in #Golang".

When I first encountered Dungeons and Dragons as a kid, I didn't understand the
difference between Intelligence and Wisdom. Either you were smart, or you
weren't. These days, for a programming language, I consider Go relatively low
INT, high WIS. That's not to say that Go is perfect, or that high INT things
aren't valuable. But I believe that there's wisdom in Go's approach.

My colleague, [Evan Martin](http://neugierig.org/software/blog/), once wrote:

Evan was talking about new programming languages and their adoption in large
organizations, but that insight is more broadly applicable. ["The XY
Problem"](http://xyproblem.info/) has already been coined to mean "asking about
your attempted *solution* rather than your actual *problem*". Perhaps we could
use "The XYZ ABC problem" to refer to (repeatedly) emphasizing something's
*benefits* when others are primarily concerned about its *costs*.
